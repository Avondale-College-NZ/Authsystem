                The High School League (HSL) is a free esports competition for Australian and New Zealand High Schools.
                It’s one of the largest trans-tasman leagues and has been running since 2017.
                2018 saw two successful seasons of the High School League as well as the inaugural HSL Holiday Cup event.
                Teams play against each other in a round robin tournament, leading into the Playoffs and culminating in a Grand Final.
                Featured matches will be broadcast every week on Twitch with the Grand Finals being showcased on SKY Sport in NZ.
                This is a chance to engage students in their playing field and use their love for video gaming to build teamwork, sportsmanship, social connections, strategic thinking.
                Esports allowed students to break down barriers and focus on their course-work.
